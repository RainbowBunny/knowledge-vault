# Note Layouts

*Every skeleton in one place. Pick a row, copy the block. The reasoning behind each lives in [[North Star]], [[Foundation Layer]] and [[Cryptography Layer]]; this file is the lookup.*

Insertable copies are in `templates/`, prefixed `layout-` — **Insert template** puts one at the cursor.

## Which layout?

| you are writing                                    | layout                 | lives in                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| a typed thing — set, relation, function, operation | **Object**             | `set theory/`                             |
| one axiom, no carriers of its own                  | **Property** (a mixin) | `properties/`                             |
| an object plus chosen axioms                       | **Structure**          | `structures/`                             |
| a concrete model of a structure                    | **Example**            | `structures/…/examples/`                  |
| a cryptographic interface — a tuple of algorithms  | **Primitive**          | `primitive/`, `proof/`                    |
| one concrete instantiation of a primitive          | **Scheme**             | `schemes/`, `scheme/`                     |

| *these two are the same thing seen differently*    | **Bridge**             | wherever its ends are                     |
| a worst-case computational problem                 | **Problem**            | `complexity/`, `cs/problems/`             |
| the average-case hardness claim                    | **Assumption**         | `cryptography/assumptions/`               |
| a security notion — any game                       | **Security property**  | `proof/properties/`, beside its primitive |
| a named result other notes invoke                  | **Theorem**            | with its subject                          |
| a hub                                              | **MOC**                | beside what it indexes                    |

**The two tests that decide most cases.** Does it declare carriers of its own? If no, it is a Property, not a Structure. Does the theorem about it carry a multiplicative loss factor? If yes, it is a Transform, not a Bridge.

**A mixin declares no carriers.** The moment it introduces a set or an operation of its own it has become a Structure.

## 3 · Structure

```markdown
Extends: [[<parent>]] + [[<the added axiom>]]

Compose by **link**. A definition that restates an axiom it could link is the one thing this vault is against.

The security callout links **up** to the primitive's game and **down** to an assumption. Without both it is a floating claim.

Slot discipline: **Parameters** point nowhere · **Setting** points down into `math/` · **Spaces** point up into the primitive · **Building Blocks** point sideways · **Parties** point into the View remark. Write only the slots that have content; the minimum is Parameters + Algorithms.

**Every Building Block must reappear in `## Security` carrying a hypothesis.** Blocks with no hypothesis mean the security section is unfinished.

## Problem

### Search Variant
Given an instance, find a solution.

### Decision Variant
Is the instance in $\mathcal L_\mathcal R = \{\mathbf x : \exists \mathbf w,\ (\mathbf x, \mathbf w) \in \mathcal R\}$?

## Claim

**No distribution appears here.** `### Scope` is the instance *format*; a measure on it belongs to the Assumption.

## 9 · Assumption — average case

Two traps. **"Decision" means membership in the Problem note and distinguishing here** — they are different questions. And **worst-case NP-completeness does not imply average-case hardness**; codes have no worst-case→average-case reduction, lattices do. Say so in `## Claim`.

## 10 · Security property — any game, not just proof systems

```markdown
## Definition

> [!definition] <Name>
> ### Scope
> A <primitive> $\Pi$; an [[Adversary]] class $\mathbb A$; auxiliary algorithms (<simulator, extractor>).
>
> ---
> ### Condition
> - **Access** — what $\mathcal A$ may query and when: the oracle set ($\mathcal O_\mathsf{find}, \mathcal O_\mathsf{guess}$),
>   or the response map $\mathcal O$ for a proof system.
> - **Promise** — what the challenger guarantees about the input ($\mathbf x \in \mathcal L$, $\mathbf x \notin \mathcal L$, $(\mathbf x, \mathbf w) \in \mathcal R$, none).
> - **Quantifier** — $\forall \mathcal A$, and where $\exists \mathcal S$ / $\exists \mathcal E$ sits relative to it.
> - **Adaptivity** — when $\mathcal A$ commits, relative to `Setup`.
>
> ---
> ### Property
> $$\mathsf{Adv}(\mathcal A) \leq \varepsilon \qquad \text{(or } \geq 1 - \varepsilon \text{ for completeness)}$$
> A **search** game ($\Pr[\text{win}]$) or a **distinguishing** game ($|\Pr[G_0] - \Pr[G_1]|$) — see [[Security Game]].

## Variant

```

**Access is the one general knob.** [[Public-Key Encryption]] already parameterises it — $\mathsf{atk} \in \{\mathsf{cpa}, \mathsf{lta}, \mathsf{cca}\}$ selects which oracles each phase gets — and a proof system's response map is the same slot under another name.

Those four Condition lines are not a wish list: **each one is a place something broke.** Access → an adversary handed the *real* state in a simulated branch. Promise → completeness confused with soundness. Quantifier → a simulator with no $\exists$. Adaptivity → a non-adaptive model written adaptively.

**Where it stops.** Correctness has no adversary; succinctness is a complexity predicate, not a game; and UC / composability is a different framework entirely (an ideal functionality and an environment, not a two-party experiment). Do not force those into this shape.

## 12 · Theorem

A theorem note is a **Property note whose Scope is its hypotheses**. There is no sixth kind of note.

```markdown
Reference:

## Definition

> [!theorem] <Name>
> ### Scope
> <the hypotheses, each symbol typed and linked>
>
> ---
> ### Condition
> <side conditions the statement silently needs>
>
> ---
> ### Property
> <the conclusion, with its bound>

## Property

### <sharpness, tightness, what fails without each hypothesis>

## Example

### <the counterexample when a hypothesis is dropped>

## Related
```

**When does a theorem graduate?** When it is **invoked, not merely known** — when other notes cite its bound or check its hypotheses. A theorem that is a fact *about* one object stays as a `[!theorem]` inside that object's note.

An empirical version of the same test, which you can just run:

```
grep -rho '^> \[!\(theorem\|lemma\|proposition\|corollary\)\] .\+' --include='*.md' . \
  | sed 's/^> \[![a-z]*\] //' | sort | uniq -c | awk '$1>=2' | sort -rn
```

**A named result stated twice has already earned a note.**

> [!remark] Which note owns a two-hypothesis theorem?
> **The one it says the most about — and you find that out by sharpening it until only one hypothesis is
> doing work.** *"A Boolean integral domain is $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$"* sharpens to *"in a Boolean ring every element
> but $0$ and $1$ is a zero divisor"*, which mentions domains not at all — so it belongs to [[Boolean Ring]],
> with a one-line pointer from [[Integral Domain]]. When sharpening does **not** collapse it, the two
> hypotheses genuinely fight, and what you have is a pair of mixins whose conjunction is degenerate.

> [!remark] Axiom or theorem — same layout, different consumption site
> The difference is epistemic, not structural, and it shows in *where the link comes from*: an **axiom** is
> linked from a `## Definition` (you stipulate it), a **theorem** from a `## Property` or `## Security`
> (you derive it). That keeps precision rule 3 — *definition ≠ theorem* — intact while letting both share
> the Scope / Condition / Property skeleton.
