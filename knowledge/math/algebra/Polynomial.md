## Basic Definition

> [!definition] Leading Coefficient
> The **leading coefficient** of polynomial is the coefficient of the highest power of $x$.

> [!definition] Monic Polynomial
> A nonzero polynomial whose leading coefficient is equal to $1$ is called a **monic polynomial**.

### Degree

> [!definition] Degree
> The **degree** of a nonzero polynomial is the exponent of the highest power of $x$ that appears.

> [!definition] Polynomial Space
> $\mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ denotes the vector space of all polynomials with coefficients in $F$ and $\mathcal P_m(\mathbb F)$ is the subspace of $\mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ consisting of the polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb F$ and degree at most $m$.

> [!definition] Roots
> A number $\lambda \in F$ is called a **root** of a polynomial $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ if $$p(\lambda) = 0.$$

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ is a polynomial with degree $m \geq 1$. Let $\lambda \in \mathbb F$. Then $\lambda$ is a root of $p$ if and only if there is a polynomial $q \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ with degree $m - 1$ such that $$p(z) = (z - \lambda) q(z)$$ for all $z \in \mathbb F$.

> [!corollary]

> [!corollary]
> Suppose $a_0, \dots, a_m \in F$. If $$a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \dots + a_m z^m = 0$$ for all $z \in \mathbb F$, then $a_0 = \cdots = a_m = 0$.

> [!example]
> Let $\mathbb F$ be a field and let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero polynomial in $\mathbb F[x]$.
> 1. $\deg(a \cdot b) = \deg(a) + \deg(b)$.
> 2. $a$ has a multiplicative inverse in $\mathbb F[x]$ if and only if $a$ is a constant polynomial.

### Complex Coefficients

> [!theorem] Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
> Every nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has a root.

> [!corollary]
> If $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb C)$ is a nonconstant polynomial, then $p$ has a unique factorization (except the order of the factors) of the form $$p(z) = c(z - \lambda_1)\dots(z - \lambda_m),$$ where $c, \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m \in \mathbb C$.

> [!proposition]
> Let $f$ be a polynomial with real coefficients, then $$\overline{f(z)} = f(\overline{z})$$ for every complex $z$.
 
### Real Coefficients

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $p$ is a polynomial with real coefficients. If $\lambda \in \mathbb C$ is a root of $p$, then so is $\overline \lambda$.

> [!proposition]
> Let $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb R$. Then there is a polynomial factorization of the form $$x^2 + \alpha x + \beta = (x - \lambda_1) (x - \lambda_2),$$ with $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \in \mathbb R$, if and only if $\alpha^2 \geq 4 \beta$.

> [!theorem]
> If $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb R)$ is a nonconstant polynomial, then $p$ has a unique factorization (except for the order of the factors) of the form $$p(x) = c(x - \lambda_1) \dots (x - \lambda_m) (x^2 + \alpha_1 x + \beta_1) \dots (x^2 + \alpha_M x + \beta_M),$$ where $c, \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m \in \mathbb R$ and $(\alpha_1, \beta_1), \dots, (\alpha_M, \beta_M) \in \mathbb R^2$ with $\alpha_j^2 < 4 \beta_j$ for each $j$.

### Reducible

> [!definition] Irreducible
> A polynomial $p(x)$ is called **irreducible** if 
> 1. $\deg(p) > 0$, and
> 2. $p$ can not be written as a product of two polynomials of positive degree.

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $\mathbb F$ is a field. The following conditions are equivalent:
> 1. Every polynomial of positive degree in $\mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ is a product of linear factors;
> 2. Every nonzero polynomial in $\mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ is a product of linear factors: $$p(x) = a \prod_{j = 1}^{\deg p} (x - \lambda_j) \quad (\lambda_j \in \mathbb F, 0 \neq a \in \mathbb F).$$
> 3. The irreducible polynomials in $\mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ are those of degree one.
> If these equivalent conditions are satisfied, we say that $\mathbb F$ is algebraically closed.

> [!proposition]
> Any monic polynomial $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ can be written as a product of powers of distinct monic irreducible polynomials $\{q_i | 1 \leq i \leq r\}$: $$p(x) = \prod_{i = 1}^r q_i(x)^{m_i}, \quad \deg p = \sum_{i = 1}^r m_i \deg q_i.$$ Here $m_i$ and $\deg q_i$ are positive integers, so $r \leq \deg p$. This factorization of $p$ is unique up to rearranging the factors. The irreducible $q_i$ that appear are precisely the irreducible factors of $p$.

### The Euclidean Algorithm

> [!proposition] The ring $\mathbb F[x]$ is Euclidean
> Let $\mathbb F$ be a field and let $a$ and $b$ be polynomial in $\mathbb F[x]$ with $b \neq 0$. Then it is possible to write $$a = b \cdot k + r \quad \text{with} \quad k \text{ and } r \text{ polynomials, and either } r = 0 \text{ or} \deg r < \deg b.$$ We say that $a$ divided by $b$ has quotient $k$ and remainder $r$.

> [!definition] Divide
> A polynomial $p \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ is said to **divide** a polynomial $q \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ if there exists a polynomial $s \in \mathcal P(\mathbb F)$ such that $q = sp$.

> [!definition] Common Divisor
> A **common divisor** of two elements $a, b \in \mathbb F[x]$ is an element $d \in \mathbb F[x]$ that divides both $a$ and $b$. We say that $d$ is a **greatest common divisor** of $a$ and $b$ if every common divisor of $a$ and $b$ also divides $d$.

> [!proposition] The extended Euclidean algorithm for $\mathbb F[x]$
> Let $\mathbb F$ be a field and let $a$ and $b$ be polynomials in $\mathbb F[x]$ with $b \neq 0$. Then the greatest common divisor $d$ of $a$ and $b$ exists, and there are polynomials $u$ and $v$ in $\mathbb F[x]$ such that $$a \cdot u + b \cdot v = d.$$

> [!definition] Resultant
> Let $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ be polynomials with rational coefficients. If their greatest common divisor is $1$, then the extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ satisfying $$a(x) A(x) + b(x) B(x) = 1.$$ In general, even if $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ have integer coefficients, the coefficients of $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ will be rational numbers. However, we can multiply the equation by a positive integer to clear the denominator. The smallest positive integer $R$ that can be written in the form $$a(x) A(x) + b(x) B(x) = R \quad \text{with} \; A(x), B(x) \in \mathbb Z[x]$$ is called the **resultant** of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ and is denoted by $\text{Res}(a(x), b(x))$.

### The Minimal Polynomial

> [!definition] Minimal Polynomial
> A **minimal polynomial** of an element $\alpha \in \mathbb F_{q^m}$ with respect to $\mathbb F_q$ is a nonzero monic polynomial $f(x)$ of the least degree in $\mathbb F_q[x]$ such that $f(\alpha) = 0$.

> [!theorem]
> 1. The minimal polynomial of an element of $\mathbb F_{q^m}$ with respect to $\mathbb F_q$ exists and is unique. It is also irreducible over $\mathbb F_q$.
> 2. If a monic irreducible polynomial $M(x) \in \mathbb F_q[x]$ has $\alpha \in \mathbb F_{q^m}$ as a root, then it is the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ with respect to $\mathbb F_q$. 

> [!definition] Cyclotomic Coset
> Let $n$ be co-prime to $q$. The **cyclotomic coset** of $q$ (or **$q$-cyclotomic cosets**) modulo $n$ containing $i$ is defined by $$C_i = \{(i \cdot q^j \pmod n) \in \mathbb Z_n : j = 0, 1, \dots\}.$$
> A subset ${i_1, \dots, i_t}$ of $\mathbb Z_n$ is called a **complete set of representatives** of cyclotomic cosets of $q$ modulo $n$ if $C_{i_1}, \dots, C_{i_t}$ are distinct and $\cup_{j = 1}^t C_{i_t} = \mathbb Z_n$.

> [!remark]
> 3. It is easy to verify that two cyclotomic cosets are either equal or disjoint. Hence, the cyclotomic cosets partition $\mathbb Z_n$.
> 4. If $n = q^m - 1$ for some $m \geq 1$, each cyclotomic coset contains at most $m$ elements, as $q^m \equiv 1 \pmod q^m - 1$.
> 5. It is easy to see that, in the case of $n = q^m - 1$ for some $m \geq 1$, $|C_i| = m$ if $\gcd(i, q^m - 1) = 1$.

> [!theorem]
> Let $\alpha$ be a primitive element of $\mathbb F_{q^m}$. Then the minimal polynomial of $\alpha^i$ with respect to $\mathbb F_q$ is $$M^{(i)}(x) := \prod_{j \in C_i} (x - \alpha^j),$$ where $C_i$ is the unique cyclotomic coset of $q$ module $q^m - 1$ containing $i$.

> [!remark]
> 1. The degree of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha^i$ is equal to the size of the cyclotomic coset containing $i$.
> 2. $\alpha^i$ and $\alpha^k$ has the same minimal polynomial if and only if $i, k$ are in the same cyclotomic coset.

> [!theorem]
> Let $n$ be a positive integer with $\gcd(q, n) = 1$. Suppose that $m$ is a positive integer satisfying $n | (q^m - 1)$. Let $\alpha$ be a primitive element of $\mathbb F_{q^m}$ and let $M^{(j)}(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha^j$ with respect to $\mathbb F_q$. Let $\{s_1, \dots, s_t\}$ be a complete set of representatives of cyclotomic cosets of $q$ modulo $n$. Then the polynomial $x^n - 1$ has the factorization into monic irreducible polynomials over $\mathbb F_q$:
> $$x^n - 1 = \prod_{i = 1}^r M^{((q^m - 1)s_i / n)}(x).$$

> [!corollary]
> Let $n$ be a positive integer with $\gcd(q, n) = 1$. Then the number of monic irreducible factors of $x^n - 1$ over $\mathbb F_q$ is equal to the number of cyclotomic cosets of $q$ modulo $n$.

## Polynomial Interpolation

> [!theorem] Polynomial Interpolation
> A polynomial of degree at most $t - 1$ is uniquely determined by $t$ points on the polynomial.

> [!lemma] Linearity of Interpolation
> Let $q$ be a prime, let $J \subseteq \mathbb Z_q$ be a set of size $t$, and let $j^* \in \mathbb Z_q$. Then there is a collection of values $\{\lambda_j\}_{j \in J}$, with each $\lambda_j \in \mathbb Z_q$, such that the following holds:
> - For every polynomial $\omega \in \mathbb Z_q[x]$ of degree at most $t - 1$, we have $$\omega(j^*) = \sum_{j \in J} \lambda_j \omega(j).$$
> Moreover, the values $\lambda_j$ for $j \in J$ are efficiently computable given $J$ and $j^*$.

> [!corollary] Interpolation in the Exponent
> Let $\mathbb G$ be a group of prime order $q$. Let $J \subseteq \mathbb Z_q$ be a set of size $t$, and let $j^* \in \mathbb Z_q$. Given $J, j^*$, as well as a collection of group elements of the form $\{h^{\omega(j)}\}_{j \in J}$, where $h \in \mathbb G$ and $\omega \in \mathbb Z_q[x]$ is a polynomial of degree at most $t - 1$, we can efficiently compute the group element $h^{\omega(j^*)}$.

## Characteristic Polynomial

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$, and $0 \neq v_0 \in V$. Define $$v_j = T^j v_0.$$ Let $m$ be the smallest positive integer with the property that $$v_m \in \text{span}(v_0, \dots, v_{m - 1}) = U.$$
> Then $(v_0, \dots, v_{m - 1})$ is linearly independent, so there is a unique expression $$v_m = -a_0 v_0 - \cdots - a_{m - 1} v_{m - 1}.$$ Define $$p(x) = x^m + a_{m - 1} x^{m - 1} + \cdots + a_0,$$ a monic polynomial of degree $m \geq 1$ in $\mathcal P(\mathbb F)$.
> 1. The $m$-dimensional subspace $U$ of $V$ is preserved by $T$: $TU \subset U$.
> 2. The linear transformation $$p(T) = T^m + a_{m - 1} T^{m - 1} + \cdots + a_0 I$$ acts by zero on $U$.
> 3. If $z$ is a polynomial and $z(T)$ acts by zero on $U$, then $z$ is divisible by $p$.
> 4. The eigenvalues of $T$ on $U$ are precisely the roots of $p$.
> 5. If $q$ is an irreducible polynomial and $\text{Null}(q(T))$ has a nonzero intersection with $U$, then $q$ divides $p$.

> 2. If $p$ does not equal the characteristic polynomial of $A$, then $p(T)$ is invertible.

> [!theorem]
> Suppose $V$ is a real vector space and $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Suppose that with respect to some basis of $V$, the matrix of $T$ is $$\begin{bmatrix}A_1 & & * \\ & \ddots & \\ 0 & & A_m\end{bmatrix},$$ where each $A_j$ is a $1$-by-$1$ matrix or a $2$-by-$2$ matrix with no eigenvalues.
> 1. If $\lambda \in \mathbb R$, then precisely $\dim \text{null} (T - \lambda I)^{\dim V}$ of the matrices $A_1, \dots, A_m$ equal the $1$-by-$1$ matrix $[\lambda]$.

We define the **characteristic polynomial** of $T$ to be the product of the characteristic polynomial of $A_1, \dots, A_m$. Explicitly, for each $j$, define $q_j \in \mathcal P(\mathbb R)$ by $$q_j(x) = \begin{cases}x - \lambda &\text{if } A_j = [\lambda]; \\ (x - a)(x - d) - bc &\text{if } A_j = \begin{bmatrix}a & c \\ b & d\end{bmatrix}. \end{cases}$$ Then the characteristic polynomial of $T$ is $$q_1(x) \dots q_m(x).$$

> Let $\mathbb F$ be field and let $m \in \mathbb F[x]$ be a nonzero polynomial. Then every nonzero congruence class $\overline a \in F[x] / (m)$ has a unique representative $r$ satisfying $$\deg r < \deg m \quad \text{and} \quad a \equiv r \pmod m.$$

> [!corollary] 
> Let $\mathbb F_p$ be a finite field and let $m \in \mathbb F_p[x]$ be a nonzero polynomial of degree $d \geq 1$. Then the quotient ring $\mathbb F_p[x] / (m)$ contains exactly $p^d$ elements.

>[!proposition] 
>Let $\mathbb F$ be a field and let $a, m \in \mathbb F[x]$ be polynomials with $m \neq 0$. Then $\overline a$ is a unit in the quotient ring $\mathbb F[x] / (m)$ if and only if $$\gcd(a, m) = 1.$$

> [!corollary] 
> Let $\mathbb F$ be a field and let $m \in \mathbb F[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial. Then the quotient ring $\mathbb F[x] / (m)$ is a field, i.e., every nonzero element of $\mathbb F[x] / (m)$ has a multiplicative inverse.

> [!corollary] 
> Let $\mathbb F_p$ be a finite field and let $m \in \mathbb F_p[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $d \geq 1$. Then $\mathbb F_p[x] / (m)$ is a field with $p^d$ elements.

> [!definition] Reciprocal Polynomial
> Let $h(x) = \sum_{a_i x^i}$ be a polynomial of degree $k (a_k \neq 0)$ over $\mathbb F_q$. Define the **reciprocal polynomial** $h_R(x)$ of $h(x)$ by $$h_R(x) = x^k h(1 / x) = \sum_{i = 0}^k a_{k - i} x^i$$  

> [!remark]
> If $h(x)$ is a divisor of $x^n - 1$, then so is $h_R(x)$.

## Ternary Polynomials

> [!definition] Ternary Polynomials
> For any positive integers $d_1$ and $d_2$, we let $$ \mathcal{T}(d_1,d_2) = \{\, a(x) \in R : \begin{align}
& d_1 \text{ coefficients are } 1,\\
& d_2 \text{ coefficients are } -1,\\
& \text{others are } 0\end{align}\}.$$ Polynomials in $\mathcal T(d_1, d_2)$ are called **ternary (or trinary) polynomials**.
