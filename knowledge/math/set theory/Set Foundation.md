## Definition

## Cardinality

> [!definition] Cardinality
> Consider a set $A$. If $A$ has only a finite number of elements, its cardinality is simply the number of elements in $A$.

### Countability

> [!definition] Countable Set
> Set $A$ is called countable if one of the following is true
> 1. If it is a finite set, $|A| < \infty$; or
> 2. it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers $\mathbb N$, in which case the set is said to be countably infinite.

> [!definition] Uncountable Set
> A set is called uncountable if it is not countable.

> [!theorem]
> Any subset of a countable set is countable.
> Any superset of an uncountable set is uncountable.
> If $A_1, A_2, \cdots$ is a list of countable sets, then the set $\bigcup_i A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cdots$ is also countable.
> If $A$ and $B$ are countable, then $A \times B$ is also countable.

> [!example]
> The set of all subsets of $\mathbb N$, $A = \{B : B \subset \mathbb N\}$ has a one-to-one correspondence to $[0, 1]$ so the set is uncountable.

## Russell's Paradox

> [!proposition] Russell's Paradox
> Let $R = \{x \;|\; x \notin x\}$. Then $R \in R \Longleftrightarrow R \notin R$.
