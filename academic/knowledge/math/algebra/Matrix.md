> [!definition] Identity Matrix
> For a vector space $V$, the identity operator $I \in \mathcal L(V)$ has a diagonal matrix $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & & 0 \\ & \ddots & \\ 0 & & 1\end{bmatrix}.$$ This matrix is called the **identity matrix** and is denoted $I$.

> [!definition] Invertible Matrix
> A square matrix $A$ (with entries in $\mathbb F$) is called **invertible** if there is a square matrix $B$ of the same size such that $AB = BA = I$, and we call $B$ an **inverse** of $A$. Because the inverse is unique, we use the notation $A^{-1}$ to denote the inverse of $A$.

## The Matrix of a Linear Map

> [!definition] Matrix of a Map
> Define $T: F^n \rightarrow F^m$ by $$T(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (\sum_{k = 1}^n a_{1, k} x_k, \dots, \sum_{k = 1}^n a_{m, k} x_k).$$ The $m$-by-$n$ matrix
>  $$\begin{bmatrix}a_{1, 1} & \dots & a_{1, n} \\ \vdots & & \vdots \\ a_{m, 1} & \dots & a_{m, n} \end{bmatrix}$$ is the matrix of $T$ with respect to the bases $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ and $(w_1, \dots, w_n)$ if $$T(v_k) = \sum_{i = 1}^m a_{i, k} w_i.$$ This matrix is denoted by $\mathcal M(T, (v_1, \dots, v_n), (w_1, \dots, w_n))$.

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V, W)$ and $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ is a basis of $V$ and $(w_1, \dots, w_n)$ is a basis of $W$. Then $$\mathcal M(T(v)) = \mathcal M(T) \mathcal M(v)$$ for every $v \in V$.

## Null and Range of Matrix

> [!definition]
> The **null space** of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is $$\text{Null}(A) = \{v \in \mathbb F^n | Av = 0\}.$$
> The **range** of $A$ is $$\text{Range}(A) = \{Av \in \mathbb F^m | v \in \mathbb F^m\}.$$
> Let $c_j \in \mathbb F^m$ is the $j$-column of $A$, then the **column space** of $A$ is $$\text{Col}(A) = \text{span}(c_1, \dots, c_n) = \text{Range}(A) \subset \mathbb F^m.$$
> The **column rank** of $A$, $c\text{-rank}(A)$, is the dimension of the column space: $$c\text{-rank}(A) = \dim \text{Col}(A) = \dim \text{Range}(A).$$
> Similarly, let $r_i \in \mathbb F^n$ to be the $i$-row of $A$, we can define the **row space** of $A$ is $$\text{Row}(A) = \text{span}(r_1, \dots, r_m) \subset \mathbb F^n$$ and the **row rank**: $$r\text{-rank}(A) = \dim \text{Row}(A).$$

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix.
> 1. The row rank and column rank of $A$ are equal, and equal to the dimension of the range of $A$: $$r\text{-rank}(A) = c\text{-rank}(A) = \dim \text{Range}(A).$$ Their common value is called the rank of $A$, and written $\text{rank}(A)$.
> 2. The dimension of the null space of $A$ plus the rank of $A$ is equal to $n$.

> [!remark]
> $\dim (\text{null}(A^T)) + \text{rank}(A) = m$

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, with rows $r_1, \dots, r_m \in \mathbb F^n$. Suppose $B$ is a $p \times m$ matrix.
> 1. Each row of $BA$ is a linear combination of the rows of $A$. More precisely, the $i$-row of $BA$ is the linear combinations with coefficients given by the $i$-th row of $B$: $$\sum_{j = 1}^m b_{i, j}.$$
> 2. The row space of $BA$ is a subspace of the row space of $A$: $$\text{Row}(BA) \subset \text{Row}(A) \subset \mathbb F^n.$$
> 3. Each $1 \times n$ row vector $r_j$ may be regarded as a linear map $$r_j : \mathbb F^n \rightarrow \mathbb F, \quad r_j(v) = r_jv$$ from column vectors to $\mathbb F$, by matrix multiplication. With this notation, $$Av = \begin{pmatrix}r_1(v) \\ r_2(v) \\ \vdots \\ r_m(v)\end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb F^m.$$
> 4. The null space of $A$ is $$\text{Null}(A) = \{v \in \mathbb F^n | r_j(v) = 0 \quad (j = 1, \dots, m)\} =\{v \in \mathbb F^n | r(v) = 0 \quad (r \in \text{Row}(A))\}.$$

## Row-Echelon Form

> [!definition] Row-Echelon Form
> An $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is said to be in **row-echelon form** if the nonzero entries are restricted to an inverted staircase shape:
> 1. The first nonzero entry in each word is strictly to the **right** of the first nonzero entry in each earlier row; and
> 2. Any rows consisting entirely of zeros must follow any nonzero rows.

> [!definition] Pivots
> The **pivots** of a row-echelon matrix are the (finite) positions $(i, j(i))$ of the first nonzero entries of the nonzero row $i = 1, \cdots, r,$ with $r \leq m$ the number of nonzero rows.

> [!definition] Reduced Row-Echelon Form
> The row-echelon matrix $A$ is said to be in **reduced row-echelon form** if in addition
> 1. Each pivot entry is equal to $1$, and
> 2. All the other entries in the column of a pivot are equal to zero.

> [!proposition]
> Suppose that $A$ is in reduced row-echelon form, with $r$ pivots in the entries $\{(i, j(i)) | 1 \leq i \leq r\}$.
> 1. The first $r$ standard basis vectors $(f_1, \dots, f_r)$ of $\mathbb F^m$ are a basis of $\text{Range}(A)$. This is the column space of $A$, so $c\text{-rank}(A) = r$.
> 2. The (first) $r$ nonzero rows are a basis of the row space of $A$, so $r\text{-rank}(A) = r$.
> 3. For each free variable $x_j$, there is a vector in the null space $$n_j = e_j - \sum_{i = 1}^r a_{i, j} e_{j(i)};$$ the $n - r$ vectors $n_j$, with $x_j$ a free variable, are a basis of $\text{Null}(A)$.
> 4. The equation $Ax = b$ has a solution if and only if $b_i = 0$ for all $i > r$. In that case, one solution is $$x_{j(i)} = b_i \quad (1 \leq i \leq r), \quad x_j = 0 \quad (x_j \text{ free variable}).$$
> 5. Still assuming that $b_i = 0$ for all $i > r$, the most general solution of $Ax = b$ has arbitrary values $x_j$ for the $n - r$ free variables, and $$x_{j(i)} = b_i - \sum_{j \text{ free}} a_{i, j} x_j \quad (1 \leq i \leq r).$$

## Elementary Row Operation

> [!definition] Elementary Row Operation
> Suppose $Ax = B$ is a system of $m$ equations in $n$ unknowns. An **elementary row operation** is one of the four procedures below:
> 1. **Multiply** the $i$-th equation by a nonzero scalar $\lambda$ ($M(i; \lambda)$): $$(a_{i1}, \dots, a_{in}) \rightsquigarrow (\lambda a_{i1}, \dots, \lambda a_{in}), \quad b_i \rightsquigarrow \lambda b_i.$$
> 2. **Add** a multiple $\mu$ of the $j$-th equation to a **later** equation $i$, with $1 \leq j < i \leq m$ ($L(i, j; \mu)$): $$(a_{i1}, \dots, a_{i_n}) \rightsquigarrow (a_{i1} + \mu a_{j1}, \dots, a_{in} + \mu a_{jn}), \quad b_i \rightsquigarrow b_i + \mu b_j.$$
> 3. **Add** a multiple $\mu$ of the $j$-th equation to a **earlier** equation $i$, with $1 \leq i < j \leq m$ ($U(i, j; \mu)$): $$(a_{i1}, \dots, a_{i_n}) \rightsquigarrow (a_{i1} + \mu a_{j1}, \dots, a_{in} + \mu a_{jn}), \quad b_i \rightsquigarrow b_i + \mu b_j.$$
> 4. **Exchange** equations $i$ and $j$ ($E(i, j)$). $$\begin{align}(a_{j1}, \dots, a_{jn}) \rightsquigarrow (a_{i1}, \dots, a_{in}), \quad b_j \rightsquigarrow b_i \\ (a_{i1}, \dots, a_{in}) \rightsquigarrow (a_{j1}, \dots, a_{jn}), \quad b_i \rightsquigarrow b_j  \end{align}$$

> [!proposition]
> Suppose that we are give a system of $m$ simultaneous linear equations is $n$ unknowns $Ax = b$.
> 1. Performing an elementary row operation is the same as multiplying $A$ and $b$ on the left by the corresponding elementary matrix.
> 2. Multiplying $A$ and $b$ on the left by any $p \times m$ matrix $C$ can only enlarge the set of solutions. That is, any solution $x$ of $Ax = b$ is also solution of $(CA)x = Cb$.
> 3. The elementary row matrices are all invertible: $$\begin{align}M(i; \lambda)^{-1} &= M(i; \lambda^{-1}); &L(i, j; \mu)^{-1} &= L(i, j; -\mu); \\ U(i, j; \mu)^{-1} &= U(i, j; -\mu); &E(i, j)^{-1} &= E(i, j).\end{align}$$
> 4. Elementary row operations do not change the solutions of $Ax = b$.
> 
> Consequently any finite sequence of elementary row operations amounts to left multiplication of $A$ and $b$ by an invertible $m \times m$ matrix $L$, and does not change the set of solutions. 

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix.
> 1. Elementary row operations do not change the null space $\text{Null}(A) \subset \mathbb F^n$. In particular, they do not change the nullity $\dim \text{Null}(A)$.
> 2. Elementary row operations do not change the row space $\text{Row}(A) \subset \mathbb F^m$. In particular, they do not change the row rank $r\text{-rank}(A)$.
> 3. Applying a sequence of elementary row operations is equivalent to left multiplication of $A$ by an invertible $m \times m$ matrix $L$. The effect of this is to apply $L$ to $\text{Range}(A) \subset \mathbb F^m$: $$\text{Range}(LA) = \text{Col}(LA) = L(\text{Col}(A)) = L(\text{Range}(A)).$$
> 4. Elementary row operations do not change the column rank $c\text{-rank}(A)$.

> [!theorem]
> Suppose $n$ and $r$ are nonnegative integers. There is a one-to-one correspondence between $r$-dimensional subspaces $U \subset \mathbb F^n$, and $r \times n$ matrices $A$ in reduced row-echelon form, with one pivot in each row.

> [!theorem]
> Suppose $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with entries in a field $\mathbb F$. Then we can perform a finite sequence of elementary row operations on $A$ to obtain a new $m \times n$ matrix $A'$ in reduced row-echelon form. More precisely, we perform
> 1. At most $m$ row operations of type $M$ interspersed with at most $m(m - 1)/2$ operations of type $L$.
> 2. At most $m(m - 1)/2$ operations of type $E$; then
> 3. At most $m(m - 1)/2$ operations of type $U$.
> 
> Consequently, we can write $$A' = UELA, \quad A = L^{-1} E^{-1} U^{-1} A'.$$
> Here $L$ and $L^{-1}$ are $m \times m$ invertible lower-triangular matrices; $E$ and $E^{-1}$ are invertible $m \times m$ permutation matrices; and $U$ and $U^{-1}$ are invertible $m \times m$ upper-triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal. The reduced row echelon matrix $A$ is unique.

## Augmented Matrix

> [!proposition]
> Suppose that $A$ is a $m \times n$ matrix of $\text{rank } r = n$ (so that $m \leq n$). Form an augmented matrix $\tilde{A} = (A | I_m)$ of size $m \times (m + n)$. Perform Gaussian elimination: $$\tilde{A} = (A | I_m) \xrightarrow{Gauss} (A' | L)$$ with $$A' = \begin{pmatrix}I_n \\ 0_{m \times n}\end{pmatrix}$$ and $L$ is the $m \times m$ matrix which is the product of all the elementary row matrices used to reduce $A$. Write $B$ for the $n \times m$ matrix consisting of the first $n$ rows of $L$. Then $$LA = A', \quad BA = I_n$$ and thus we have found the left inverse $B$ of $A$. 

## Eigenvalues of Square Matrices

> [!definition] Eigenvalue of a Square Matrices
> Suppose $A$ is an $n$-by-$n$ matrix with entries in $\mathbb F$. A number $\lambda \in \mathcal F$ is called an **eigenvalue** of $A$ if there exists a nonzero $n$-by-$1$ matrix $x$ such that $$Ax = \lambda x.$$

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ and $A$ is the matrix of $T$ with respect to some basis of $V$. Then the eigenvalues of $T$ are the same as the eigenvalues of $A$.

## Upper-Triangular Matrices

> [!theorem]
> Every operator on a finite-dimensional, nonzero, complex vector space has an eigenvalue.

> [!definition] Diagonal
> The **diagonal** of a square matrix consists of the entries along the straight line from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner. (.i.e $a_{1, 1}, a_{2, 2}, \dots, a_{n, n}$)

> [!definition] Upper Triangular
> A matrix is called **upper triangular** if all the entries below the diagonal equal $0$.

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ and $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ is a basis of $V$. Then the following are equivalent:
> 1. The matrix of $T$ with respect to $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$ is upper triangular;
> 2. $T(v_k) \in \text{span}(v_1, \dots, v_k)$ for each $k = 1, \dots, n$;
> 3. $\text{span}(v_1, \dots, v_k)$ is invariant under $T$ for each $k = 1, \dots, n$.

> [!theorem]
> Suppose $V$ is a complex vector space and $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then $T$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis of $V$.

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis of $V$. Then $T$ is invertible if and only if all the entries on the diagonal of that upper-triangular matrix are nonzero.

> [!proposition]
> Suppose $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis of $V$. Then the eigenvalues of $T$ consist precisely of the entries on the diagonal of that upper-triangular matrix.

## Diagonal Matrices

> [!definition] Diagonal Matrix
> A **diagonal matrix** is a square matrix that is $0$ everywhere except possibly along the diagonal.

> [!proposition]
> If $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ has $\dim V$ distinct eigenvalues, then $T$ has a diagonal matrix with respect to some basis of $V$.

## Block Upper-Triangular Matrices

> [!definition] Block Upper-Triangular Matrix
> A **block upper-triangular matrix** is a square matrix of the form $$\begin{bmatrix}A_1 & & * \\ & \ddots & \\ 0 & & A_m\end{bmatrix},$$ where $A_1, \dots, A_m$ are square matrices lying along the diagonal.

> [!theorem]
> Suppose $V$ is a real vector space and $T \in \mathcal L(V)$. Then there is a basis of $V$ with respect to which $T$ has a block upper-triangular matrix $$\begin{bmatrix}A_1 & & * \\ & \ddots & \\ 0 & & A_m\end{bmatrix}.$$ where each $A_j$ is a $1$-by-$1$ matrix or a $2$-by-$2$ matrix with no eigenvalues.
